State Workflow Bundle
=====================

Helping you implementing a complex yet easily maintainable workflow.
---------------------------------------------

Keywords : State Design Pattern, Workflow, Finite State Machine, Symfony2

# WIP



![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmorel/StateWorkflowBundle/master/doc/booking-wokflow.png "Workflow")

Our `StateWorkflow` object is responsible for managing all your `States` and their `Transitions` for your given `Entity`.
Every single State is a class implementing our `StateInterface` and is managing its own transitions.


### Ubiquitous Language
- State : an Entity finite state at a given time (ex: `Booking payed`, `Quote cancelled`, etc..)
- Transition : a transition between state A and state B (ex: `Booking waiting for payment` --`Send confirmation mail`-> `Booking payed`, etc..)


### Pros
- All your workflow described via classes (States are services)
- Each State is responsible from **its own transitions**
- Each State Transition can **contain logic** (Log, Event Sourcing, Assertion, etc..)
- All your workflow can be easily **Unit Tested**
- Entity's current state can be **easily stored** in database (simple string)
- Workflow **specification doc can be generated from code**


### Cons
- Each time you add a transition you have to modify your own interface extending `StateInterface` implementation
- If you only need a Finite State Machine without logic in your transitions. You might prefer https://github.com/yohang/Finite
- Not really follows the famous precept : prefer composition over inheritance..



###Â Usage

```php

$bookingStateWorkflow = $this->get('demo.booking_engine.state_workflow');

// Initialize entity state to booking workflow default state : incomplete
// Booking __construct contains 
// $bookingStateWorkflow->getDefaultState()->initialize($this);
$booking = new Booking($bookingStateWorkflow, 200);

// Set incomplete entity as paid
// Take care of the state transition (incomplete -> paid)
// Send confirmation mail
$booking->getState($bookingStateWorkflow)->setBookingAsPaid($booking);

// Get current booking state : StatePaid
$currentState = $booking->getState($bookingStateWorkflow);

```

### Implementation example

Booking Demo https://github.com/gmorel/StateWorkflowDemo

### Details

It will allow you to manage `States` and especially their available `Transitions` for an `Entity` (for example a Booking class) implementing our ```HasStateInterface```.
It is aiming at helping implementing a complex `Workflow` where each `State` implementing our ```StateInterface``` is responsible for its `Transitions` (methods) to other `States`.
Some `Transitions` being impossible (not part of your `Workflow`) and then throwing the ```UnsupportedStateActionException``` exception whenever called.

Each `State` is a *service* tag (ex: ```demo.booking_engine.state```).
This way you will be able to manage available `States` for different `Entities` by using other *tags* (ex: Booking, Content and Customer shall not share the same `Workflow`/`States`). 
You will then need to modify the CompilerPass in order to let your `Workflow` be aware of its `States`.

#### Adding new State:

In case you wish to add a new `State` you will need to create a new Class implementing our ```StateInterface``` interface.

#### Adding new Transition:

In case you wish to add a new `Transition` you will need to add a new method in your ```XXXStateInterface``` extending our ```StateInterface```. 
You can also use our helper ```AbstractState``` to implement default behavior ie. a method throwing our `UnsupportedStateTransitionException`.
